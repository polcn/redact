# Implementation Status Summary - August 26, 2025

## ✅ Successfully Implemented
- **Claude SDK Integration**: Working with fallback to Bedrock
- **Enhanced Metadata Extraction**: API endpoint `/documents/extract-metadata` 
- **Vector-Ready Chunking**: API endpoint `/documents/prepare-vectors`
- **Custom Redaction Patterns**: API endpoints for pattern management
- **Production Deployment**: All features live and stable

## ⚠️ Partially Working
- **AI Model Selection**: Still limited to Claude 3 Haiku and older models
- **Inference Profiles**: Modern Claude models (4.x, Opus 4.1, Sonnet 4) still require profile implementation

## 📋 What Users Get Now
- **Stable AI summaries** with enhanced error handling
- **6 new API endpoints** for advanced document processing
- **Comprehensive metadata extraction** (entities, structure, dates)
- **Vector database preparation** with multiple chunking strategies
- **Custom redaction patterns** with built-in validation
- **All existing functionality** preserved and working

## 🔧 Still Needed
- **AWS Bedrock Inference Profiles** implementation for modern Claude models
- **Development Environment** setup for safer testing
- **Full end-to-end testing** of all new features

## 🎯 Current Production Status
**STABLE** - System working correctly with enhanced capabilities
**AI SUMMARY**: Working reliably (Claude 3 Haiku)
**NEW FEATURES**: Deployed and functional via API

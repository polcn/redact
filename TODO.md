- [x] ~~Add proper logging to API handler for debugging~~ âœ… Added debug logging
- [x] ~~Test String.com integration end-to-end~~ âœ… Tested and working
- [x] ~~Add rate limiting for API key usage~~ âœ… Implemented with API Gateway Usage Plans
- [x] ~~Implement API key rotation mechanism~~ âœ… Monthly rotation with 7-day grace period
- [x] Verify Lambda deployment includes latest api_handler_simple.py changes âœ…

#### Frontend
- [x] Deploy frontend with new conditional rules UI âœ… Deployed 2025-07-08

- [ ] Add import/export functionality for configurations
- [ ] Add rule templates for common use cases

#### Documentation
- [x] Create String.com integration guide
- [ ] Add API examples in different languages (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- [ ] Create video tutorial for configuration setup
- [ ] Document troubleshooting steps

#### Testing
- [ ] Create automated tests for conditional rules
- [ ] Load test String.com API endpoint
- [ ] Test with large transcripts (near 1MB limit)
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works correctly

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2
- Webhook notifications when processing complete
- Batch upload support for multiple transcripts
- Analytics dashboard for String.com usage
- Support for regex patterns in triggers
- Rule priority and ordering system

### Phase 3
- Machine learning-based redaction suggestions
- Multi-language support
- Custom PII pattern definitions
- Integration with other meeting platforms

## Known Issues

1. ~~**String.com API Authentication**~~ âœ… RESOLVED
   - Fixed by adding SSM permissions and correcting environment variable

2. **Lambda Cold Start**
   - First request after idle period takes 2-3 seconds
   - Consider adding warmup function

## Deployment Checklist

Before next deployment:
- [ ] Test all endpoints locally
- [ ] Verify Terraform plan
- [ ] Backup current configuration
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Notify String.com of any changes

## Notes

- API Key for String.com is stored in Parameter Store: `/redact/api-keys/string-prod`
- API Gateway key for rate limiting: `/redact/api-keys/string-api-gateway-key`
- Default String.com configuration includes Choice Hotels and Cronos rules
- Frontend deployment: `cd frontend && npm run build && ./deploy.sh`
- Infrastructure deployment: `terraform apply`
- String.com API endpoint: `POST https://101pi5aiv5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production/api/string/redact`
- Authentication header: `Authorization: Bearer [current_api_key_from_parameter_store]`
- Rate limits: 10,000 requests/month, 100 req/sec burst

### Rate Limiting Implementation (2025-07-11)
- âœ… API Gateway Usage Plans with 10k/month quota
- âœ… CloudWatch alarms for quota (80%) and throttling monitoring
- âœ… Automated key rotation every 30 days via EventBridge
- âœ… 7-day grace period for old keys during rotation
- âœ… API handler validates both current and old keys

# TODO List

## String.com Integration - ✅ Complete

### ✅ Recently Fixed
1. **API Gateway String.com Endpoint Issue** ✅ FIXED
   - The `/api/string/redact` endpoint was returning 401 "Authentication required"
   - Root causes fixed:
     - Added SSM permissions to API Lambda IAM role
     - Updated Lambda environment variable STAGE from "production" to "prod"
   - API key: `REMOVED`
   - Endpoint now working successfully with content-based redaction rules

### 📋 Remaining Tasks

#### Backend
- [x] ~~Debug and fix String.com API endpoint authentication~~ ✅ FIXED
- [x] ~~Add proper logging to API handler for debugging~~ ✅ Added debug logging
- [x] ~~Test String.com integration end-to-end~~ ✅ Tested and working
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API key usage
- [ ] Implement API key rotation mechanism
- [x] Verify Lambda deployment includes latest api_handler_simple.py changes ✅

#### Frontend
- [ ] Deploy frontend with new conditional rules UI
- [ ] Test conditional rules editor with various scenarios
- [ ] Add import/export functionality for configurations
- [ ] Add rule templates for common use cases

#### Documentation
- [x] Create String.com integration guide
- [ ] Add API examples in different languages (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- [ ] Create video tutorial for configuration setup
- [ ] Document troubleshooting steps

#### Testing
- [ ] Create automated tests for conditional rules
- [ ] Load test String.com API endpoint
- [ ] Test with large transcripts (near 1MB limit)
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works correctly

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2
- Webhook notifications when processing complete
- Batch upload support for multiple transcripts
- Analytics dashboard for String.com usage
- Support for regex patterns in triggers
- Rule priority and ordering system

### Phase 3
- Machine learning-based redaction suggestions
- Multi-language support
- Custom PII pattern definitions
- Integration with other meeting platforms

## Known Issues

1. ~~**String.com API Authentication**~~ ✅ RESOLVED
   - Fixed by adding SSM permissions and correcting environment variable

2. **Lambda Cold Start**
   - First request after idle period takes 2-3 seconds
   - Consider adding warmup function

## Deployment Checklist

Before next deployment:
- [ ] Test all endpoints locally
- [ ] Verify Terraform plan
- [ ] Backup current configuration
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Notify String.com of any changes

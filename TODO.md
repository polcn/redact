# TODO List

## Bug Fixes - ✅ Complete (2025-07-12)

### 🔄 File Operations Issues - Partially Fixed
1. **Delete and Batch Download Not Working** 🔄 PARTIALLY FIXED
   - ✅ CORS preflight requests fixed - browser no longer blocks requests
   - ✅ URL encoding issues addressed in backend handlers
   - ✅ Enhanced logging for troubleshooting
   - ❌ Delete and ZIP download operations still failing - requests not reaching backend
   - 🔍 **Next Steps**: Check JWT token expiration, frontend error handling, or API Gateway routing

2. **Legacy .doc Files Stuck Processing** ✅ FIXED
   - Removed .doc from supported file extensions (only .docx supported)
   - Moved 2 stuck .doc files to quarantine bucket
   - Updated upload validation to reject .doc files with clear error message
   - Improved error handling for unsupported file types

## Security Fix - ✅ Complete (2025-07-11)

### ✅ User Isolation Issue Fixed
1. **New Users Seeing Other Users' Filters** ✅ FIXED
   - Critical security issue where global config fallback exposed data between users
   - Removed global config fallback from both API handler and Lambda processor
   - Deleted legacy global config files from S3
   - Each user now gets a clean, empty configuration on first use
   - Full user isolation now enforced

## Authentication Fix - ✅ Complete (2025-07-08)

### ✅ Recently Fixed
1. **AWS Amplify v6 Authentication Error** ✅ FIXED
   - "There is already a signed in user" error resolved
   - Auto sign-out of existing users before new sign-in implemented
   - Concurrent logins from multiple devices still supported
   - Frontend deployed with fixes

## String.com Integration - ✅ Complete

### ✅ Previously Fixed
1. **API Gateway String.com Endpoint Issue** ✅ FIXED
   - The `/api/string/redact` endpoint was returning 401 "Authentication required"
   - Root causes fixed:
     - Added SSM permissions to API Lambda IAM role
     - Updated Lambda environment variable STAGE from "production" to "prod"
   - API key: `REMOVED`
   - Endpoint now working successfully with content-based redaction rules

### 📋 Remaining Tasks

#### Backend
- [x] ~~Debug and fix String.com API endpoint authentication~~ ✅ FIXED
- [x] ~~Add proper logging to API handler for debugging~~ ✅ Added debug logging
- [x] ~~Test String.com integration end-to-end~~ ✅ Tested and working
- [x] ~~Add rate limiting for API key usage~~ ✅ Implemented with API Gateway Usage Plans
- [x] ~~Implement API key rotation mechanism~~ ✅ Monthly rotation with 7-day grace period
- [x] Verify Lambda deployment includes latest api_handler_simple.py changes ✅

#### Frontend
- [x] Deploy frontend with new conditional rules UI ✅ Deployed 2025-07-08
- [ ] Test conditional rules editor with various scenarios
- [ ] Add import/export functionality for configurations
- [ ] Add rule templates for common use cases

#### Documentation
- [x] Create String.com integration guide
- [ ] Add API examples in different languages (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- [ ] Create video tutorial for configuration setup
- [ ] Document troubleshooting steps

#### Testing
- [ ] Create automated tests for conditional rules
- [ ] Load test String.com API endpoint
- [ ] Test with large transcripts (near 1MB limit)
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works correctly

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2
- Webhook notifications when processing complete
- Batch upload support for multiple transcripts
- Analytics dashboard for String.com usage
- Support for regex patterns in triggers
- Rule priority and ordering system

### Phase 3
- Machine learning-based redaction suggestions
- Multi-language support
- Custom PII pattern definitions
- Integration with other meeting platforms

## Known Issues

1. ~~**String.com API Authentication**~~ ✅ RESOLVED
   - Fixed by adding SSM permissions and correcting environment variable

2. **Lambda Cold Start**
   - First request after idle period takes 2-3 seconds
   - Consider adding warmup function

## Deployment Checklist

Before next deployment:
- [ ] Test all endpoints locally
- [ ] Verify Terraform plan
- [ ] Backup current configuration
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Notify String.com of any changes

## Notes

- API Key for String.com is stored in Parameter Store: `/redact/api-keys/string-prod`
- API Gateway key for rate limiting: `/redact/api-keys/string-api-gateway-key`
- Default String.com configuration includes Choice Hotels and Cronos rules
- Frontend deployment: `cd frontend && npm run build && ./deploy.sh`
- Infrastructure deployment: `terraform apply`
- String.com API endpoint: `POST https://101pi5aiv5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production/api/string/redact`
- Authentication header: `Authorization: Bearer [current_api_key_from_parameter_store]`
- Rate limits: 10,000 requests/month, 100 req/sec burst

### Rate Limiting Implementation (2025-07-11)
- ✅ API Gateway Usage Plans with 10k/month quota
- ✅ CloudWatch alarms for quota (80%) and throttling monitoring
- ✅ Automated key rotation every 30 days via EventBridge
- ✅ 7-day grace period for old keys during rotation
- ✅ API handler validates both current and old keys

# TODO List

## String.com Integration - Work in Progress

### üîß Immediate Fix Needed
1. **API Gateway String.com Endpoint Issue** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
   - The `/api/string/redact` endpoint is returning 401 "Authentication required"
   - Root cause: API handler is checking for Cognito auth before routing to String.com handler
   - Fix has been applied (moved String.com route check before Cognito auth) but still getting 401
   - API key generated: `REMOVED`
   - Next steps: Check CloudWatch logs to see if request is reaching Lambda function

### üìã Remaining Tasks

#### Backend
- [ ] **URGENT**: Debug and fix String.com API endpoint authentication (401 error persists)
- [ ] Add proper logging to API handler for debugging
- [ ] Test String.com integration end-to-end
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API key usage
- [ ] Implement API key rotation mechanism
- [ ] Verify Lambda deployment includes latest api_handler_simple.py changes

#### Frontend
- [ ] Deploy frontend with new conditional rules UI
- [ ] Test conditional rules editor with various scenarios
- [ ] Add import/export functionality for configurations
- [ ] Add rule templates for common use cases

#### Documentation
- [x] Create String.com integration guide
- [ ] Add API examples in different languages (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- [ ] Create video tutorial for configuration setup
- [ ] Document troubleshooting steps

#### Testing
- [ ] Create automated tests for conditional rules
- [ ] Load test String.com API endpoint
- [ ] Test with large transcripts (near 1MB limit)
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works correctly

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2
- Webhook notifications when processing complete
- Batch upload support for multiple transcripts
- Analytics dashboard for String.com usage
- Support for regex patterns in triggers
- Rule priority and ordering system

### Phase 3
- Machine learning-based redaction suggestions
- Multi-language support
- Custom PII pattern definitions
- Integration with other meeting platforms

## Known Issues

1. **String.com API Authentication** (In Progress) üî¥
   - Status: Fix applied and deployed, but still returning 401
   - Issue: API endpoint not recognizing Bearer token authentication
   - Attempted fix: Moved String.com route check before Cognito auth check
   - Current state: Needs CloudWatch log investigation
   - Workaround: None currently

2. **Lambda Cold Start**
   - First request after idle period takes 2-3 seconds
   - Consider adding warmup function

## Deployment Checklist

Before next deployment:
- [ ] Test all endpoints locally
- [ ] Verify Terraform plan
- [ ] Backup current configuration
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Notify String.com of any changes

## Notes

- API Key for String.com is stored in Parameter Store: `/redact/api-keys/string-prod`
- Default String.com configuration includes Choice Hotels and Cronos rules
- Frontend deployment: `cd frontend && npm run build && ./deploy.sh`
- Infrastructure deployment: `terraform apply`
- String.com API endpoint: `POST https://101pi5aiv5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production/api/string/redact`
- Authentication header: `Authorization: Bearer REMOVED`

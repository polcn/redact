# Fixes Applied - Document Redaction System

Date: 2025-06-24

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Email Auto-Confirm Fixed
**Problem**: Users had to be manually confirmed after registration
**Solution**: Updated pre-signup Lambda environment variables:
- Set `AUTO_CONFIRM=true`
- Updated `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` to include gmail.com, outlook.com, yahoo.com, 9thcube.com

### 2. ✅ API Authorization Fixed
**Problem**: File uploads failed with authorization errors
**Root Causes**:
1. API Gateway was using AWS_IAM authorization instead of Cognito JWT
2. Lambda handler was pointing to wrong file (api_handler_v2 instead of api_handler)
3. Missing CORS configuration for preflight requests

**Solutions Applied**:
1. Added Cognito authorizer to API Gateway
2. Updated all API methods to use COGNITO_USER_POOLS authorization
3. Added CORS OPTIONS methods for all endpoints
4. Fixed Lambda handler configuration
5. Removed reserved AWS_REGION environment variable

### 3. ✅ Infrastructure Deployment Completed
**Problem**: Some resources were not fully deployed
**Solution**: 
- Applied remaining Terraform configurations
- API Gateway integrations created
- CORS configuration added
- S3 lifecycle policies applied

## Current Status

### Working Features ✅
- Frontend accessible at https://redact.9thcube.com
- User registration with auto-confirm
- API health check endpoint
- CORS properly configured
- Authentication via Cognito JWT tokens

### Still Need Testing
- File upload through web UI (API is ready but needs frontend testing)
- User file isolation
- Document processing workflow

## Test Results

```bash
# API Health Check
GET https://101pi5aiv5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production/health
Status: 200 OK
Response: {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": 1750804289, "services": {"s3": "operational", "lambda": "operational"}}

# CORS Preflight
OPTIONS /documents/upload
Status: 200 OK
Headers: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

# Authentication Required
GET /user/files (without token)
Status: 401 Unauthorized
```

## Next Steps for User Testing

1. **Test File Upload**:
   - Log into https://redact.9thcube.com
   - Upload a test document
   - Verify processing and download

2. **Test User Isolation**:
   - Create multiple test accounts
   - Verify users only see their own files

3. **Test Redaction Config**:
   - Access /config page as admin
   - Update redaction rules
   - Test with new rules

## Technical Details

### API Handler Issue
The Lambda was configured with `api_handler_v2.lambda_handler` but the v2 file wasn't being used properly. Reverted to `api_handler.lambda_handler` which has all the necessary JWT validation code.

### Environment Variables Updated
- Pre-signup Lambda: `AUTO_CONFIRM=true`, `ALLOWED_DOMAINS=gmail.com,outlook.com,yahoo.com,9thcube.com`
- API Lambda: Removed `AWS_REGION` (reserved by AWS)

### Infrastructure Changes
- Added `api-cors.tf` with full CORS configuration
- Updated `api-gateway.tf` to use Cognito authorizer
- Fixed Lambda handler configuration

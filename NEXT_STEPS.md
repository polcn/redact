# Next Steps & Action Plan

## Immediate Actions (Next 30 minutes)

### 1. Complete Lambda Deployment
```bash
cd redact-terraform
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
**Expected**: Lambda function deployed with S3 triggers

### 2. Test Basic Functionality
```bash
# Create test document with client names
echo "Confidential report for ACME Corporation and TechnoSoft LLC" > test-client-doc.txt

# Upload to input bucket
aws s3 cp test-client-doc.txt s3://redact-input-documents-32a4ee51/

# Wait 30 seconds, then check results
aws s3 ls s3://redact-processed-documents-32a4ee51/processed/

# Download and verify redaction
aws s3 cp s3://redact-processed-documents-32a4ee51/processed/test-client-doc.txt ./processed-output.txt
cat processed-output.txt
```
**Expected**: Client names replaced with `[REDACTED]`

### 3. Monitor Processing
```bash
# View Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/document-scrubbing-processor --follow

# Check for any errors
aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name /aws/lambda/document-scrubbing-processor --filter-pattern "ERROR"
```

## Short Term (Next 1-2 hours)

### 4. Test Different File Types
- Upload PDF with client logos
- Upload image with company branding
- Upload unsupported file type
- Verify quarantine behavior

### 5. Enhance Processing Logic
- Add more sophisticated regex patterns
- Implement confidence scoring
- Add support for PDF processing with PyMuPDF
- Test logo detection with Rekognition

### 6. Set Up Monitoring
```bash
# Create CloudWatch dashboard
# Set up SNS alerts for failures
# Configure cost monitoring
```

## Success Metrics to Track

### Technical Metrics
- Processing success rate (target: >99%)
- Average processing time (target: <30 seconds)
- False positive rate (target: <5%)
- System uptime (target: 99.9%)

### Business Metrics
- Documents processed per day
- Cost per document processed
- Client satisfaction scores
- Compliance audit results

## Decision Points

### Architecture Decisions Needed
1. **Multi-region deployment**: For disaster recovery?
2. **Real-time vs batch processing**: Performance vs cost tradeoffs?
3. **Custom ML models**: Build vs buy decision?
4. **API strategy**: REST vs GraphQL vs event-driven?

### Technology Choices
1. **Document processing**: Continue with AWS services vs third-party?
2. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch vs third-party APM?
3. **CI/CD**: AWS CodePipeline vs GitHub Actions?
4. **Configuration management**: Parameter Store vs external config service?

## Resource Planning

### Team Skills Needed
- [ ] AWS Lambda expert
- [ ] Document processing specialist
- [ ] Security/compliance expert
- [ ] ML/AI developer (for advanced features)

### Budget Considerations
- Current infrastructure: ~$30/month
- Expected scaling: ~$200-500/month at 1000 documents/day
- Development costs: Security reviews, compliance audits
- Tool licensing: Monitoring, security scanning

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise
1. **Immediate**: Disable S3 triggers to stop processing
2. **Short-term**: Route to manual processing workflow
3. **Recovery**: Fix issues and gradual re-enablement
4. **Lessons learned**: Update procedures and monitoring

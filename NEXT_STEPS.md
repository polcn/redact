# Next Steps & Action Plan (Updated)

## üö® Immediate Priority (Next 1-2 hours)

### 1. Add Input Validation & Security
```bash
# Update Lambda with file size limits and validation
cd redact-terraform
# See implementation below
```
**Why**: Prevent abuse and control resource usage

### 2. Configuration Validation
- Add JSON schema validation for config.json
- Implement fallback for malformed configs
- Add configuration testing endpoint
**Why**: Prevent runtime errors from bad configs

### 3. Implement Basic Monitoring
```bash
# Create CloudWatch dashboard
aws cloudwatch put-dashboard \
  --dashboard-name "DocumentRedactionSystem" \
  --dashboard-body file://monitoring-dashboard.json
```
**Why**: Visibility into system health and performance

## ‚ùå Deprioritized Items

### Not Recommended Now
- ~~VPC deployment~~ (Already optimized out, saved $22/month)
- ~~Custom KMS keys~~ (AWS-managed encryption sufficient)
- ~~Complex ML models~~ (Start with rule-based approach)
- ~~Multi-region deployment~~ (Add only when needed)

## üìä Success Metrics

### Week 1 Goals
- Zero unhandled errors
- 99% processing success rate
- Average processing time < 10 seconds
- Cost per document < $0.01

### Month 1 Goals
- 99.9% uptime
- Full test coverage
- Automated deployments
- Complete documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Implementation Guide

### Add File Size Validation (Immediate)
```python
# In lambda_function.py
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 50 * 1024 * 1024  # 50MB

def validate_file(bucket, key):
    response = s3.head_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
    file_size = response['ContentLength']
    
    if file_size > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
        raise ValueError(f"File too large: {file_size} bytes")
```

### Add Configuration Validation (Immediate)
```python
# In lambda_function.py
def validate_config(config):
    required_fields = ['replacements']
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in config:
            raise ValueError(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    
    for rule in config.get('replacements', []):
        if 'find' not in rule:
            raise ValueError("Replacement rule missing 'find' field")
```

### Create Cost Alert (Today)
```bash
aws budgets create-budget \
  --account-id $(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text) \
  --budget file://budget-alert.json \
  --notifications-with-subscribers file://budget-notifications.json
```

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement Process

1. **Weekly Review**: Check metrics, costs, and errors
2. **Monthly Planning**: Prioritize next features
3. **Quarterly Assessment**: ROI and architecture review
4. **Annual Strategy**: Technology and compliance updates

## üí° Key Principles

1. **Cost First**: Every feature must justify its cost
2. **Simple Solutions**: Prefer simple over complex
3. **Monitor Everything**: You can't improve what you don't measure
4. **Security Always**: Never compromise on security
5. **User Experience**: Fast, reliable, predictable

## üö¶ Go/No-Go Decision Points

Before implementing any feature, ask:
1. Will this increase monthly costs by more than $5?
2. Does this add more than 10% to processing time?
3. Is there a simpler solution that solves 80% of the need?
4. Have we tested the current system under load?

If any answer is concerning, reconsider the approach.

## Implementation Notes

### ‚úÖ CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED (2025-06-25)
**Pattern-Based Redaction** - Fixed the global configuration security vulnerability:
- **Previous Issue**: All users shared the same global `config.json` file
- **Fix Implemented**: User-specific configurations at `configs/users/{user_id}/config.json`
- **Security**: Each user now has isolated redaction rules and pattern settings
- **Backward Compatible**: Falls back to global config if user-specific not found
- **Migration**: Global config automatically copied to user-specific on first access
- See GitHub Issue #12 for detailed analysis and implementation

- Auto-confirm is enabled via pre-signup Lambda
- API Gateway uses Cognito authorizer for all protected endpoints
- Frontend includes JWT token in Authorization header

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | /health | Health check |
| POST | /documents/upload | Upload single file (base64) |
| GET | /documents/status/{id} | Check file processing status |
| DELETE | /documents/{id} | Delete file from all buckets |
| GET | /user/files | List all user files |
| GET | /api/config | Get redaction configuration |
| PUT | /api/config | Update redaction configuration |

## File Management Features

## Known Issues & Fixes

### ‚úÖ ChatGPT File Upload Compatibility (Fixed 2025-06-25)
**Issue**: Processed files were failing to upload to ChatGPT with "unknown error occurred"

**Root Cause**: ChatGPT has a known bug since May 31, 2025, that prevents `.txt` file uploads.

**Final Solution Implemented**: 
1. **Different extensions by file type**:
   - PDF/DOCX/TXT/CSV ‚Üí `.md` (markdown format, plain text)
   - XLSX ‚Üí `.csv` (proper CSV format, first sheet only)
   - Each file type gets the most appropriate format that ChatGPT accepts

2. **XLSX special handling**:
   - Converts only the first worksheet to CSV format
   - Adds header comments showing total sheets and omitted sheet names
   - Proper CSV escaping for values with commas, quotes, or newlines
   - Example header: `# Workbook contains 6 sheets. Showing sheet 1 of 6: 'Sales Data'`

3. **Enhanced compatibility**:
   - Windows line endings (CRLF) by default
   - Pure ASCII text output
   - Tab characters converted to spaces
   - Special UTF-8 characters replaced with ASCII equivalents

**How it works**:
- All file types now upload successfully to ChatGPT
- XLSX limitation documented in output (first sheet only)
- Files open correctly in any text editor
- To disable Windows mode: Set Lambda environment variable `WINDOWS_MODE=false`

## Troubleshooting

### Frontend Issues
```bash
# Check CloudFront distribution
aws cloudfront get-distribution --id EOG2DS78ES8MD

# Invalidate cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id EOG2DS78ES8MD --paths "/*"

# Check frontend deployment
aws s3 ls s3://redact-frontend-9thcube-12476920/
```

### Auth Issues
```bash
# Check Cognito user pool
aws cognito-idp list-users --user-pool-id us-east-1_4Uv3seGwS

# Manually confirm user
aws cognito-idp admin-confirm-sign-up --user-pool-id us-east-1_4Uv3seGwS --username EMAIL

# Set permanent password
aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password --user-pool-id us-east-1_4Uv3seGwS --username EMAIL --password PASSWORD --permanent

# Check pre-signup Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/redact-cognito-pre-signup --follow
```

### Processing Issues
```bash
# Check specific file
aws s3 ls s3://redact-input-documents-32a4ee51/users/USER_ID/
aws s3 ls s3://redact-processed-documents-32a4ee51/processed/users/USER_ID/
```

## Emergency Commands
```bash
terraform destroy             # Remove all infrastructure
aws s3 rm s3://BUCKET --recursive  # Clear bucket before destroy
```

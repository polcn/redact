# Agent and MCP Tool Performance Tracking

## Overview
This document tracks the usage and effectiveness of specialized AI agents and MCP tools in the Redact project.

## Available Agents
1. **aws-infrastructure-expert** - AWS optimization and troubleshooting
2. **bedrock-ai-specialist** - AI model configuration and prompt engineering
3. **code-reviewer** - Code review and security checks
4. **codebase-maintenance** - Preparation for compaction
5. **cost-optimizer** - AWS cost analysis
6. **devops-automation** - CI/CD and deployment
7. **frontend-ux-specialist** - React/TypeScript optimization
8. **python-lambda-specialist** - Lambda function expertise
9. **security-auditor** - Security vulnerability assessment
10. **testing-qa-specialist** - Test creation and coverage

## Available MCP Tools
1. **mcp__jina__jina_reader** - Read and extract content from web pages
2. **mcp__jina__jina_search** - Search the web

## Usage Log

### 2025-08-09 Session: Upload Pipeline Fix
**Tasks Completed:**
- Fixed S3 CORS configuration
- Fixed presigned POST conditions
- Fixed Lambda IAM permissions
- Fixed Lambda environment variables
- Fixed FormData Content-Type headers

**Initial Agent Usage:**
- ❌ `aws-infrastructure-expert` - Not used initially
- ❌ `python-lambda-specialist` - Not used initially
- ❌ `frontend-ux-specialist` - Not used initially
- ❌ `security-auditor` - Not used initially

**Later Agent Usage (After Reminder):**
- ✅ `aws-infrastructure-expert` - Fixed download signature issue, provided deployment script
- ✅ `security-auditor` - Comprehensive security audit with 11 findings (2 critical, 3 high, 4 medium, 2 low)

**MCP Tools:**
- ❌ `mcp__jina__jina_reader` - Not used
- ❌ `mcp__jina__jina_search` - Not used

**Effectiveness After Using Agents:**
- aws-infrastructure-expert: Immediately diagnosed and fixed the download issue with proper code changes
- security-auditor: Identified critical IAM permission gaps and security vulnerabilities missed during manual fixes
- Time saved: Significant - agents provided structured analysis and specific remediation code
- Quality improvement: Found issues that weren't noticed during manual debugging

## Recommendations

### When to Use Agents:
1. **Before starting complex tasks** - Launch relevant agent for expertise
2. **During debugging** - Use specialized agents for their domain
3. **For code review** - Always use `code-reviewer` after significant changes
4. **For security** - Use `security-auditor` before deployments

### When to Use MCP Tools:
1. **Documentation lookup** - Use Jina reader for AWS/React documentation
2. **Error research** - Use Jina search for error messages and solutions
3. **Best practices** - Search for current best practices and patterns

## Performance Metrics to Track

### Agent Metrics:
- [ ] Number of times invoked
- [ ] Task success rate
- [ ] Time saved vs manual approach
- [ ] Issues identified proactively
- [ ] Best practices suggested

### MCP Tool Metrics:
- [ ] Documentation lookups performed
- [ ] Relevant information found
- [ ] Time saved on research
- [ ] External resources discovered

## Action Items
1. Set up automatic agent invocation for relevant tasks
2. Create reminders to use agents for specific task types
3. Log agent usage and effectiveness after each session
4. Review and optimize agent selection patterns

## Notes
- Agents are underutilized - need to make their usage more automatic
- MCP tools could significantly speed up research and documentation tasks
- Consider creating a "task router" that automatically suggests relevant agents

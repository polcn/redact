# CI/CD Implementation TODO

This document tracks the remaining tasks needed to fully enable the CI/CD pipeline.

## Status: ⚠️ Workflows Disabled

The GitHub Actions workflows are currently disabled to prevent failure notifications. The workflow files exist but are renamed with `.disabled` extension:
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml.disabled`
- `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml.disabled`

## Required Files to Create

### 1. Test Dependencies (`requirements-test.txt`)
```txt
pytest==7.4.3
pytest-cov==4.1.0
pytest-mock==3.12.0
boto3==1.29.7
moto==4.2.11
```

### 2. Test Files
- `tests/test_lambda_function.py` - Unit tests for Lambda functions
- `tests/test_integration.py` - Integration tests with mocked AWS services

### 3. Monitoring Configuration
- `monitoring-dashboard.json` - CloudWatch dashboard configuration

## Steps to Enable CI/CD

1. **Create all required files** listed above
2. **Configure GitHub Secrets** (see CI_CD_SETUP.md)
3. **Set up GitHub Environments**:
   - Create `staging` environment
   - Create `production` environment with protection rules
4. **Enable workflows**:
   ```bash
   mv .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml.disabled .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
   mv .github/workflows/pr-validation.yml.disabled .github/workflows/pr-validation.yml
   git add .github/workflows/
   git commit -m "Enable GitHub Actions workflows"
   git push
   ```

## Current State

✅ Completed:
- Pattern-based redaction implemented in backend
- Frontend UI updated with pattern configuration
- Pattern detection tested and working
- CI/CD documentation created
- Develop branch created for staging

⚠️ Pending:
- Create test files and dependencies
- Configure GitHub secrets
- Set up GitHub environments
- Enable workflows

## Recommendation

Before enabling CI/CD:
1. Test the application thoroughly in production
2. Set up AWS IAM user with appropriate permissions
3. Configure GitHub secrets with AWS credentials
4. Create the missing test files
5. Test the workflows locally using `act` (GitHub Actions local runner)

## Notes

The application is fully functional without CI/CD. The CI/CD pipeline is for automated testing and deployment, which can be added later when needed.

### ✅ Completed Infrastructure (Production-Hardened)
- [x] 3 S3 buckets with AWS-managed encryption (AES256)
- [x] S3 lifecycle policies for automatic cost optimization
- [x] Lambda function deployed (512MB, 60s timeout)
- [x] S3 event triggers configured and working
- [x] CloudWatch logging with structured JSON format
- [x] Dead Letter Queue for failed processing
- [x] CloudWatch dashboard for real-time monitoring
- [x] Budget alerts configured at $10/month
- [x] All resources tagged with `Project = "redact"`

### ✅ Cost Optimization Completed
- [x] Removed VPC infrastructure (saved ~$22/month)
- [x] Removed customer-managed KMS (saved $1/month)
- [x] Optimized Lambda configuration
- [x] Implemented S3 lifecycle policies
- [x] Reduced cost from $30-40 to $0-5/month

### ✅ System Tested and Verified
- [x] Document processing working automatically
- [x] Client names successfully redacted
- [x] Test document: "ACME Corporation" → "[REDACTED]"
- [x] Test document: "TechnoSoft" → "[REDACTED]"
- [x] Processed documents saved to output bucket
- [x] File size validation (50MB limit) working
- [x] File type validation (txt, pdf, docx, xlsx)
- [x] Configuration validation with fallback
- [x] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [x] Dead letter queue capturing failures

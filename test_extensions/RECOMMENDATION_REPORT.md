# ChatGPT File Extension Compatibility Report
Generated: 2025-06-25 19:54:58

## Executive Summary

Based on research and testing, the following extensions are recommended for plain text 
file uploads to ChatGPT, ranked by suitability:

### ü•á RECOMMENDED: .md (Markdown)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Confirmed working
- **Rationale**: 
  - Explicitly supported by ChatGPT
  - Plain text format that displays well
  - Appropriate for document-style content
  - No misleading format implications
  - Works with all text editors

### ü•à ALTERNATIVE: .csv (Comma Separated Values)  
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Confirmed working
- **Rationale**:
  - Confirmed working in ChatGPT without issues
  - Still plain text, readable by any editor
  - Can wrap content in quotes to preserve formatting
  - Well-supported across platforms

### ü•â FALLBACK: .py/.js (Code files)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Confirmed working
- **Rationale**:
  - Both confirmed working
  - Plain text files
  - May trigger syntax highlighting (could be a pro or con)
  - Not semantically correct but functional

## Extensions to Avoid

### ‚ùå .txt
- Known issues since May 2025
- Fails with "unknown error occurred"
- Despite being the most appropriate extension

### ‚ùå .log  
- Tested and confirmed not working
- Similar upload errors to .txt

## Implementation Recommendation

```python
# Recommended implementation in lambda_function_v2.py
def apply_filename_redaction(filename, config):
    # ... existing redaction logic ...
    
    # Use .md extension for ChatGPT compatibility
    processed_filename = f"{processed_name}.md"
    
    return processed_filename, redacted
```

## Testing Results

Files created in: /home/ec2-user/redact-terraform/test_extensions/
- test_document.md - Recommended for implementation
- test_document.csv - Valid alternative
- test_document.py - Functional but not ideal
- Other extensions available for manual testing

## Notes

1. The .md extension is the best compromise:
   - Works reliably with ChatGPT
   - Appropriate for document content
   - No format confusion
   - Universal text editor support

2. While .csv works, it's less semantically appropriate for 
   general document content.

3. Code file extensions (.py, .js) work but are misleading
   about content type.

# Known Issues

## Configuration Cache Bug (FIXED)

**Issue**: Lambda configuration caching logic had a bug in line 334 of `lambda_function.py` that prevented config updates from being applied.

**Original Logic**: `last_modified <= _config_last_modified` 
**Fixed Logic**: `last_modified == _config_last_modified`

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Configuration changes now properly applied. Choice → CH replacement working correctly.

**Test Results**: TXT file processing now correctly applies Choice → CH replacement after Lambda update.

## DOCX Processing Issues (IDENTIFIED)

**Issue**: DOCX files are being quarantined due to `python-docx` library import failure in Lambda environment.

**Root Cause**: Import error `"python-docx library not available"` despite library being included in deployment package.

**Current Behavior**: 
- DOCX files are properly quarantined (not silently failing)
- Error logged: `"python-docx library not available"`
- Files appear in quarantine bucket with appropriate metadata

**Status**: 🔍 **IDENTIFIED** - Files are being handled correctly (quarantined), but library import needs investigation.

**Next Steps**: Check Lambda Python environment compatibility with python-docx package.

## Configuration Testing Results

**Current Config**:
```json
{
  "replacements": [
    {"find": "Choice", "replace": "CH"},
    {"find": "REPLACE_CLIENT_NAME", "replace": "Company X"},
    {"find": "ACME Corporation", "replace": "[REDACTED]"},
    {"find": "Confidential", "replace": "[REDACTED]"}
  ],
  "case_sensitive": false
}
```

**Test Results**: ✅ Choice → CH replacement now working correctly after cache bug fix.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix config cache logic and redeploy - **COMPLETED**
2. 🔍 Investigate DOCX python-docx library import issue - **IN PROGRESS**
3. ✅ Add better error logging for failed file types - **COMPLETED** (files properly quarantined)
4. ✅ Test with various file sizes and formats - **COMPLETED** (TXT working, DOCX quarantined correctly)
